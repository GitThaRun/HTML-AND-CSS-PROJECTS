            Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
            ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian
            Space Research Organisation, where he
            was project director of the SLV-III, the
            first satellite launch vehicle that was

            <br><br> 
            ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                Kalam planned the program that produced
                a number of successful missiles, which
                helped earn him the nickname <strong>
                    “Missile Man.”</strong><br><br>
            ☛ Among those successes
                    was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                    ballistic missile, which incorporated
                    aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                    in 1989.

                    forward a countrywide plan called
                    Technology Vision 2020, which he described
                    as a road map for transforming India from
                    a less-developed to a developed society
                    in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                    other measures, increasing agricultural
                    productivity, emphasizing technology as
                    a vehicle for economic growth, and
                    widening access to health care and
                    education.
